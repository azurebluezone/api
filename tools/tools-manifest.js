/**
 * tools-manifest.js — single source of truth for what the server exposes
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHY
 *   The docs claim 36 tools. The live registry reported 131. Both numbers
 *   were "true" but they meant different things, and nothing in the code
 *   distinguished them — so nobody could tell whether the docs were stale or
 *   the server had grown:
 *
 *     26  core      built into api.js (files, shell, agents, db, web)
 *     10  external  the MCP servers the project itself ships
 * (ocr, screen-recorder, tts)          ── together: 36  docs
 *     95  pluggable third-party MCP servers the operator adds
 *                   (public-api, facebook-ads, combined)  ── optional
 *
 *   `CORE_TOOL_COUNT` (36) is what the documentation talks about.
 *   `EXTERNAL_MCP_SOURCES` are extras: they appear in tools/list when their
 *   server is reachable and silently disappear when it is not. A missing
 *   pluggable server must never look like a broken core.
 *
 * Consumers:
 *     tests/docs-claims.test.js  — verifies the 36 claim against CORE only
 *     /api/tools/manifest        — reports the split to the admin panel
